The Arduino Support Package adds Blaze Support into the Arduino IDE.

Once the Support Package is installed, "Blaze" becomes available as a selectable "Board Type" option.

Prior to downloading a Sketch to Blaze, Blaze needs to enter Bootloader Mode. To do this, a simple tap
of the screen just after connecting via USB will force Blaze to remain in the bootloader. While in the
bootloader, Arduino IDE will detect the USB-to-Serial port provided by the Blaze board and use this for
uploading sketches to Blaze.
