Blaze KDS Examples
=========================

#4 USB

This example allows Blaze to run as a USB virtual serial port.

When the application runs, a virtual serial port appears and outputs touch position
data from the touch controller. To capture this touch position data, connect a terminal
client such as PuTTY or Hyperterminal to the correct COM port and you will see the X
and Y coordinates of your finger position when you drag over the screen.
